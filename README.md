# Spoken Digit Recognition

This project is aimed at recognizing spoken digits from 0 to 9, using a combination of time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The dataset used in this project consists of .wav files of spoken digits. The data was processed and analyzed using the librosa library.

In addition to data analysis, data augmentation techniques were used to improve the performance of the model. Time-stretching and pitch-shifting were applied to the data to increase its size and variability.

The models used in this project are based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The best F1 score of 90% was achieved on the frequency-domain representation of the data.
